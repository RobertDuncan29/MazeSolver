# MazeSolver
In a smaller project done in my Data Structures class in the Fall 2022 semester, I made a script that, when given a matrix, would find the path through the matrix, 
like a maze. This code when given the starting point and ending point, will traverse through the matrix and find the correct path in which the maze should be followed. 
The code checks all directions (N, S, E, W) and when faced with a dead end, will go backwards in order to continue to find the correct path. The implementation of 
multiple stacks were used in this project to properly traverse the maze.
